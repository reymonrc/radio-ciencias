## Victor Hugo

**A Hugo boilerplate for creating truly epic websites**

This is a boilerplate for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as your asset pipeline.

Victor Hugo setup to use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for CSS and JavaScript compiling/transpiling.

This project is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE). Please make sure you understand its implications and guarantees.

## Usage

### :exclamation: Prerequisites



### :construction_worker: Development

While developing your website, use:

### :package: Static build

See [package.json](package.json#L8) for all tasks.

## Structure

```
|--site                // Everything in here will be built with hugo
|  |--content          // Pages and collections - ask if you need extra pages
|  |--data             // YAML data files with any data for use in examples
|  |--layouts          // This is where all templates go
|  |  |--partials      // This is where includes live
|  |  |--index.html    // The index page
|  |--static           // Files in here ends up in the public folder
|--src                 // Files that will pass through the asset pipeline
|  |--css              // Webpack will bundle imported css separately
|  |--index.js         // index.js is the webpack entry for your css & js assets
```

## Basic Concepts

You can read more about Hugo's template language in their documentation here:

https://gohugo.io/templates/overview/

The most useful page there is the one about the available functions:

https://gohugo.io/templates/functions/

For assets that are completely static and don't need to go through the asset pipeline,
use the `site/static` folder. Images, font-files, etc, all go there.

Files in the static folder end up in the web root. So a file called `site/static/favicon.ico`
will end up being available as `/favicon.ico` and so on...

The `src/index.js` file is the entrypoint for webpack and will be built to `/dist/main.js`

You can use **ES6** and use both relative imports or import libraries from npm.

Any CSS file imported into the `index.js` will be run through Webpack, compiled with [PostCSS Next](http://cssnext.io/), and
minified to `/dist/[name].[hash:5].css`. Import statements will be resolved as part of the build.

## Deploying to Netlify

- Push your clone to your own GitHub repository.
